# Project Idea: "Library Management System"
This will be a Library Management System (LMS) where users can:
Add new books.
View a list of books.
Edit or remove books.
Search for books by title or author.
Borrow and return books (keep track of availability).
Store all book data in a file for persistence across program runs.

<br/>

# Features of this Project:
Add a Book: Users can add a new book with details like title, author, ISBN, genre, and availability.
View Books: Display all the books with their details.
Edit Book: Users can update book details.
Remove Book: Delete a book from the system.
Search Books: Search by title or author.
Borrow and Return Books: Mark a book as borrowed or returned.
Data Persistence: Save and load the books list from a file (books.txt) when the program starts.
Command-line interface (CLI): Interact with the system via console commands.

<br/>

# OOP Concepts Covered:
Classes and Objects: For representing books, library operations, and the library itself.
Encapsulation: Private fields with getters and setters for book attributes.
Inheritance: (If you want to extend) You could extend functionality like having different types of books (e.g., textbooks, fiction).
Polymorphism: In method overriding when editing or borrowing books.
File I/O: For saving and reading data.
